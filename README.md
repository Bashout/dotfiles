# dotfiles

My dotfiles are managed using GNU Stow.

My editors of choice:
* [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) & [Tmux](https://tmux.github.io/) - My main
  editor.
* [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/) - For when more power is required.
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Backup editor (using VSCodeVim).

These config files are all dedicated to the Public Domain, without any
conditions whatsoever.

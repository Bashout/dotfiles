# dotfiles

My dotfiles are managed using GNU Stow.

My editors of choice:
* [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) (& [Tmux](https://tmux.github.io/)) - My
  main/favourite editor.
* [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/) - For when more power is required.
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Backup editor (using
  [VSCodeVim](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim)).

*My personal Vim configuration. Using [Vivid.vim] as the plugin manager, and
[Space-vim-dark] as the theme.*

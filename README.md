commit a58a692b3ac6e52930b2902c200b3b6714bb3f5e

    The final (major) changes... Hopefully
    
    I realise now, that I am spending too much time customising my workflow
    environments and tools, it is consuming pretty much all of my free time.
    I would rather be using this time more wisely, and learning new tools,
    languages and concepts, working on existing projects, starting new ones
    and contributing more to open source.
    
    I must learn to live with the defaults. After all perfection is near
    impossible.
